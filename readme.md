## Overview

Description of the project in detail.

A collection of 3 pages 1st is the landing page which connects to the other 2 pages which contain different types of Feature pages. The feature pages test our skills from past projects to design and add features such as animations to its elements. To make those features we were instructed that we were allowed to use CSS and javascript for said features.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
